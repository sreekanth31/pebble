Overview

* What is Pebble?

    Pebble is a lightweight, open source, Java EE blogging tool. It's small, fast
    and feature-rich with unrivalled ease of installation and use. Blog content is
    stored as XML files on disk and served up dynamically, so there's no need to
    install a database. All maintenance and administration can be performed
    through your web browser,  making Pebble ideal for anybody who is constantly
    on the move or doesn't have direct access to their host.  You can see example
    blogs {{{http://www.simongbrown.com/blog/}here}} and
    {{{http://www.olafkock.de/ok}here}}.
