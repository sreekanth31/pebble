* How do I deploy Pebble?

    Installation on most JSP 2.0/Servlet 2.4 containers should be as simple as dropping the <<<pebble.war>>> file into a
    specific directory in order to deploy it. Here are the steps required to deploy Pebble into Tomcat 5.5.x.

    [[1]] Take the <<<pebble.war>>> file from the distribution and deploy it, by copying it to
          <<<$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps>>>.
    
    [[2]] Restart Tomcat and point your browser to <<<http://localhost:8080/pebble/>>>.
    
    [[3]] Start blogging by logging in with a username of <<<username>>> and a password of <<<password>>>.

    What follows are some instructions for specific web/application servers.

* Tomcat 5.5.x

    To enable e-mail integration so that Pebble can send e-mails whenever people leave comments, copy the
    <<<activation.jar>>> and <<<mail.jar>>> files from the <<<lib>>> directory of the Pebble distribution into
    <<<$TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib/>>>.
