      Although most of the content on a blog consists of blog entries, there may be times where you'd like to include some static content.
      For example, you might want to have an "About me" page, or a page containing links to other sites that you find useful. Although you could have a separate web application serving up this content, Pebble provides a simple way to manage small amounts of static content with the following benefits.
      <ul>
        <li>Pages are included in the search feature.</li>
        <li>Page hits are included in your referers/logs.</li>
        <li>Pages and blog entries have a consistent look and feel.</li>
      </ul>
      The key differences between a blog entry and static page are that static pages simply consist of a title and body, don't have comments/TrackBacks and have a more memorable permalink such as <code>${blogUrl}pages/aboutme.html</code>.

    <h3>Adding a static page</h3>
    <p>
      To add a static page, click the <a href="addStaticPage.secureaction">New static page</a> link after logging in.
      The important form field to fill in is "Name", and it's this that makes up the memorable permalink to the page. The name you give a page must only contain alphanumeric characters, numbers, '-', '_' or '/'. Examples include "aboutme", "articles/SomeArticleName", and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Switching on/off the rich text editor for the body of the static page can be done through your <a href="editUserPreferences.secureaction">user preferences</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Managing static pages</h3>
    <p>
      To manage your static pages, click the <a href="viewStaticPages.secureaction">Static pages</a> link.
