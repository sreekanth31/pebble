      Although weblogs are generally a public way of sharing ideas and opinions, there may be times when you want to set up a private blog - perhaps a dedicated project blog or a blog that only family members can access.
    </p>

    <h3>Making your blog private</h3>
    <p>
      To make your blog private and password protected, simply edit the list of users that you would like to be blog readers
      on your <a href="viewBlogSecurity.secureaction">blog security</a> page. Once users are enlisted as blog readers, they will
      be required to enter their username and password to access your blog. Likewise for your blog's RSS and Atom feeds.
    </p>

    <h3>Opting out of aggregation (multi-blog mode only)</h3>
    <p>
      In multi-blog mode, all blogs will automatically show up on the multi-user front page and their content will appear in the combined news feeds. To stop this from occurring you can opt-out your blog on the <a href="viewBlogProperties.secureaction">blog properties</a> page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Allowing your content to be aggregated in conjunction with the <a href="./help/contentDecorators.html#publishingExcerpts">ExcerptDecorator</a>
      gives you a way to publish excerpts and require people to be registered readers to view the full content (e.g. for paid subscribers).
