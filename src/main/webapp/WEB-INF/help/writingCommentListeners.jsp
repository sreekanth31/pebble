    <a href="./help/commentListeners.html">Comment listeners</a> are a type of Pebble plugin that allow you to write code that is called
    whenever a comment is added, removed, approved or rejected. To write your own listener, you need to write a Java class that implements the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/api/event/comment/CommentListener.html">CommentListener</a> interface
    as shown below. To gain access to the associated
    <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/domain/Comment.html">comment</a>, use the <code>getComment()</code> method on the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/api/event/comment/CommentEvent.html#getComment()">CommentEvent</a> object
    that is passed to the callback methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      An empty implementation is provided by the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/event/comment/CommentListenerSupport.html">CommentListenerSupport</a> class, which
      you can use as a starting point. If you are writing an implementation that is useful for both comments and TrackBacks, you can
      use the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/event/response/BlogEntryResponseListenerSupport.html">BlogEntryResponseListenerSupport</a>
      as a starting point instead, where there are similar blogEntryResponseX() methods that can be overridden.
