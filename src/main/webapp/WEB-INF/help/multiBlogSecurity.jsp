      An important point to mention about multi-blog mode is security. Defining a number of users with the
      same roles (e.g. blog contributor) means that anybody with
      the appropriate role can access the corresponding functions on any blog when Pebble runs in multi-blog mode.
      For example, if you have 3 blogs (blog1, blog2 and blog3) and create a unique user for each of them,
      the blog1 user will be able to access all of the owner/publisher/contributor functionality of
      blog2 and blog3.
    </p>

      To restrict this, Pebble allows you to explicitly name those users that you wish to grant owner/publisher/contributor
      privileges to, on an individual blog basis. To do this, go to the <a href="viewBlogSecurity.secureaction">blog security</a>
      page for a blog and select (or multi-select) those users that you wish to grant access to for each of the owner, publisher and contributor roles.
