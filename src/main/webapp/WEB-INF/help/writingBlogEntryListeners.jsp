    <p>
    Blog entry listeners are a type of Pebble plugin that allow you to write code that is called
    whenever a blog entry is added, removed, changed, published or unpublished. To write your own listener, you need to write a Java class that implements the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/api/event/blogentry/BlogEntryListener.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.event.blogentry.BlogEntryListener</a> interface
    as shown below. To gain access to the associated <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/domain/BlogEntry.html">blog entry</a>, use the <code>getBlogEntry()</code> method on the
    <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/api/event/blogentry/BlogEntryEvent.html#getBlogEntry()">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.blogentry.BlogEntryEvent</a> object
    that is passed to the callback methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      An empty implementation is provided by the <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/javadoc/net/sourceforge/pebble/event/blogentry/BlogEntryListenerSupport.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.event.blogentry.BlogEntryListenerSupport</a> class, which
      you can use as a starting point.
