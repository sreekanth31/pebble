/**
 * This class is used to keep track of a thread local instance 
 * for rewriting URLs - ultimately for deciding if a link should
 * be decorated 'secure' (as in config value secureUrl) or plain.
 * 
 * The initialization (and clean up) is meant to be done in a 
 * servlet filter, so that the thread local rewriter is available 
 * to each request. This is done because a blog itself serves its
 * Url to anybody and doesn't know how to determine if it should be
 * talked to 'secure' or not.
 * 
 * In the current scenario, secureUrl may be used for logging in 
 * and performing administrative work. Be aware though that mixing
 * http and https access to an application may itself impose severe
 * risk while the user feels comfortably safe. Best and most secure 
 * mode for operation would be to go https exclusively. If you 
 * can't, the current solution (this class is participating in)
 * will help you the best it can.
